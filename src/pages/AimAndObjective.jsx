        <h2>Aim and Objectives</h2>
        <p>
          To make knowledge of space science and Astronomy accessible to all.
          Our objectives are to act for the advancement of knowledge through
          research in space science and technology.
        </p>

        <h2>Vision</h2>
        <p>
          The overarching vision for astronomy in India involves a holistic
          approach to advancing scientific research, developing national
          infrastructure, fostering talent through education and outreach, and
          promoting global collaboration in the field. Key objectives include
          answering fundamental questions about the universe, contributing to
          international mega science projects, and making astronomy accessible
          to all Indians through improved curricula and public engagement
          initiatives.
        </p>

        <h2>Mission</h2>

        <h3>• Fostering Scientific Temperament</h3>
        <p>
          Many institutions aim to cultivate a scientific mindset in students
          from a young age through hands-on learning experiences in astronomy
          and space science. Organizations like Space Technology and Education
          Pvt. Ltd (SPACE India) focus on experiential learning to make
          astronomy accessible and engaging for students.
        </p>

        <h3>• Promoting Research and Education</h3>
        <p>
          The Inter-University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics (IUCAA) is
          dedicated to promoting research and providing advanced training in
          astronomy and astrophysics. Institutions are working to establish
          astronomy and space labs (Khagolshala) in schools to facilitate
          practical learning.
        </p>

        <h3>• Developing Skilled Professionals</h3>
        <p>
          A core mission is to train future scientists, explorers, and
          entrepreneurs in the fields of astronomy and space science.
          Institutions like India Space Academy offer programs to prepare
          students for careers in the space industry and related fields.
        </p>

        <h3>• Contributing to Space Exploration and Technology</h3>
        <p>
          Many institutions participate in research related to space
          exploration, including studying celestial objects and phenomena. The
          AstroSat mission, led by ISRO, aims to understand high-energy
          processes in the universe. There is also a focus on developing space
          technology and participating in international collaborations like the
          NISAR mission.
        </p>

        <h3>• Public Outreach and Education</h3>
        <p>
          Several organizations are involved in public outreach programs to
          raise awareness about astronomy and space science. This includes
          organizing events, workshops, and educational programs to engage the
          wider community.

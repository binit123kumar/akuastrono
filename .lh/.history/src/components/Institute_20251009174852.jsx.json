Accordingly, a Centre for River\n              Studies (CRS) has been established against the backdrop of\n              disturbances being faced by rivers which are dying due to\n              pollution, over-extraction of water, emaciated tributaries and\n              climatic changes all over the world in general and India in\n              particular. Rivers have been virtually synonymous with\n              civilizations. However, over a period of time, on-going and\n              accelerating climate changes have decreased the flow of the many\n              Rivers, stressing human society and river eco-systems that are\n              dependent on the River's flow.\n            </h3>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default Institute;\n"
